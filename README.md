# HR Analytics Dashboard: Employee Attrition

This project explores the contributing factors to employee attrition using real-world HR data sourced from Kaggle. It is the first research practice under FireHua Consulting LLC, designed to apply statistical thinking and data analytics to solve meaningful organizational challenges.

### Research Questions
1. What is the correlation between attrition and demographics, compensation, work style, and employee attitude?
2. What is the correlation among those dimensions?
3. Which variables are most predictive of attrition?
4. What actionable recommendations can be made?

### Methods
- Data cleaning in Excel
- Correlational analysis using Pearson coefficients
- Statistical significance testing (p < 0.05)
- Export of results to Excel for data visualization

### Files
- `DataAnalysis.ipynb`: Full notebook with documentation and code
- `Cleaned_Employee_Data.xlsx`: Cleaned version of the dataset used
- `correlation_results.xlsx`: Final output with correlation tables

### How to Use
1. Download the dataset [here](./Cleaned_Employee_Data.xlsx) and place it in the same folder as the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells to see the analysis results.
4. View exported results in Excel.

### Next Steps
- Regression analysis to predict attrition
- Interactive dashboard development in Power BI
- Storytelling with insights
